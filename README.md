# deeplearning.ai step-by-step guide
This project provides a step-by-step guide for you easy to follow the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization course. Learning notes and python code will be included in this repo as well as other helpful references.  For more details about the series courses:

## Prerequisite
Some basic machine learning background is good for understanding the materials. Since this is a deep learning course, machine learning knowlodge will not be covered much. For you who do not have any machine learning background, I think Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is a great starting point. Hope you can find some helpful leanring notes here: [Coursera机器学习笔记(〇)-目录](http://daniellaah.github.io/2016/Machine-Learning-Andrew-Ng-My-Notes.html)

## Programming Environment
Python is used for this course. Coursera provides a cloud jupyter notebook environment called [coursera hub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/supplement/oABOh/programming-assignment-faq), you can finish your programming assignments directly on the coursera website. The following package/framework should be installed if you would like to run code on your own environment:
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)

[Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/) is a good choice for settling your own environment.

## Usage
All the materials of each course including notes/code can be found in the corresponding subfolder. Please note that the code is not solutions to the assignment but you can get hints from it.
